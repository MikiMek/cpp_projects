# C++ Projects

Variety of small / medium projects, each of them focusing on learning something new:  
From operator overloading, through multi inheritance up to smart pointers etc.

Note: Comments only partially serve as a documentation, they are often used as a reminder about behaviour of some particular tools / functions - educational purpose of the projects.
